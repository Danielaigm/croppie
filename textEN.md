#### 3.1 What is it?

Croppie is a mobile app designed to support decision making of smallholder coffee producers. It uses AI to estimate coffee yield and provides recommendations based on the analysis of farmers’ agricultural practices.

  - 50% faster than existing methods
  - Offline use
  - Standardized sampling
  - Digital evidence
  - Georeferenced information for full traceability
    
#### 3.2 How it works?

We provide a simple mobile app-based sampling protocol which leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to count coffee cherries and estimate yield on coffee farm plots.

  1. Sampling + estimated total number of trees
  2. Branch sampling + counting
  3. Image collection
  4. Image interpretation
  5. Yield estimate 
     
     
#### 3.3 Dashboard 

The dashboard proposes recommendations and alerts synchronized with the local cropping calendars in  10 critical moments of coffee production.
Identifying the potential for improvement in each cycle is crucial to obtain high quality coffee, improving plantation performance, and increasing the resilience and sustainability of practices.

Recommendations: Temperature should be regulated and air flow increased in order to improve drying without affecting flavors.


#### 3.4  Use cases

  - Producers: Tailored agronomic support  advice and targeted extension
  - Cooperatives: Improving cooperative performance and sales planning.
  - Financial institutions: Facilitating smallholder farmers’ access to loans and credits
